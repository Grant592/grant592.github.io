I'll send a prize to anyone who can name the song/band in the comments...no cheating!

So I thought I'd start a blog for a few reasons. Hopefully it'll be a good place to jot down any thoughts on anything data and stats related I find interesting/intriguing. I'm also going to be doing some stats on this seasons rugby Premiership. As a start, I'll be looking at how accurate Elo ratings will be for the upcoming season and also looking at an expected points model in a similar vein to [FiveThirtyEight](www.fivethirtyeight.com). I'll post predictions from each model prior to the round of fixtures and look at ways the model can be refined throughout the season.

Look forward to hearing any thoughts as I get started.
