After working as a sports scientist/strength and conditioning coach in professional rugby for a number of years, I now work as a Senior Data Scientist at Sage. Prior to Sage I spent a year at another north-east tech company, SaleCycle working with Big Data, building ML solutions and adding robust statistical methods to support the work we did. Now I've had time to step away from sport, I thought I'd combine my interest in data, programming and stats with my interest in rugby and create a blog to jot down some of my thoughts and projects. 

In a similar fashion to [FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/), my goal is to build a prediction model for premiership rugby fixtures such as Elo ratings and expected points and alongside that just share anything else I find interesting in data, machine learning, maths and stats.
